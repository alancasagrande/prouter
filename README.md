# easy-router
Unobtrusive and ultra-lightweight router library 100% compatible with the Backbone.Router's style for declaring routes,
while providing the following advantages:
* __Unobtrusive__, it is designed from the beginning to be integrated with other libraries / frameworks (also vanilla JS).
* __Great performance__, only native functions are used.
* __Small footprint__, 5kb for the [minified](https://developers.google.com/closure/compiler/) version.
* __No dependencies__, no jQuery, no Underscore... zero dependencies.
* __Unit testing__ included in the build process.
* Written in [ESNext](https://babeljs.io/) for the future and transpiled to ES5 with UMD format, thus it transparently supports almost every modules' style out there: [es6](https://github.com/lukehoban/es6features#modules), [commonJs](http://webpack.github.io/docs/commonjs.html), [AMD](http://requirejs.org/docs/commonjs.html), and normal browser.
* Proper [JSDoc](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSDoc) comments are used in all the [source code](https://github.com/rogerpadilla/easy-router/blob/master/js/easy-router.js).
* Tested in every common browser: Chrome, Firefox, IE9+.

Want to create a modern hibrid-mobile-app or website using something like [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/), [Web Components](http://webcomponents.org/), [Handlebars](http://handlebarsjs.com/), or vanilla JS? Want to render in both sides, the backend and the front-end? Have an existing Backbone project and want to migrate? Good news, EasyRouter integrates perfectly fine in all of those use cases!

EasyRouter provides methods for routing client-side pages, and connecting them to actions; basically, it's configured by providing a list of entries, each one with a route an a callback, and done!

Install it via [Bower](http://bower.io/) (or just download it [here](https://github.com/rogerpadilla/easy-router/tree/master/dist)):
``` bash
bower install easy-router -S
```

Just use it in the same way than the [Backbone.Router](http://backbonejs.org/#Router) component:

```javascript
var appRouter = new EasyRouter({
    routes: {
        '': function () {
            ...
        },
        'companies/new': function () {
            ...
        },
        'companies/:id': function (id) {
            ...
        },
        'signup': function () {
            ...
        },
        'login': function () {
            ...
        },
        'logout': function () {
            ...
        },
        'forgot-password': function () {
            ...
        },
		...
    }
});

EasyRouter.history.start({pushState: true});
```
