# easy-router
Unobtrusive and ultra-lightweight router library 100% compatible with the Backbone.Router
providing the following advantages:
	* Great performance (only native functions are used).
	* Small footprint (5kb for minified version).
	* No dependencies (no jQuery, no Underscore... zero dependencies).
	* Proper JSDoc used in the source code.

EasyRouter provides methods for routing client-side pages, and connecting them to actions.
