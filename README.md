# easy-router
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/rogerpadilla/easy-router.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/rogerpadilla/easy-router)

Unobtrusive, forward-thinking and ultra-lightweight client-side router library.
* __Small footprint__, 6kb for the [minified](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rogerpadilla/easy-router/master/dist/easy-router.min.js) version.
* __Great performance__, only native functions are used.
* __No dependencies__, no jQuery, no Underscore... zero dependencies.
* __Unobtrusive__, it is designed from the beginning to be integrated with other libraries / frameworks (also vanilla JS).
* __Forward-thinking__, written in [ESNext](https://babeljs.io/) for the future and transpiled to ES5 with UMD format for the present... thus it transparently supports almost every modules' style out there: [es6](https://github.com/lukehoban/es6features#modules), [commonJs](http://webpack.github.io/docs/commonjs.html), [AMD](http://requirejs.org/docs/commonjs.html), and normal browser.
* Proper [JSDoc](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSDoc) comments are used in all the [source code](https://github.com/rogerpadilla/easy-router/blob/master/js/easy-router.js).
* Unit testing for each feature is included in the build process.

Unique features:
* Send "flash" messages between routes when navigating.
* Supports "deactivate" optional-callback, called when leaving the current route.
* Register listeners before and after the routes changes.
* Cancel navigation by setting evt.canceled to true inside the callback for the event 'route:before'.
* Want to create a hibrid-mobile-app, or a web-spa using something like [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/), [Web Components](http://webcomponents.org/),[Handlebars](http://handlebarsjs.com/), or vanilla JS? Want to render in both sides, the backend and the front-end? Have an existing project and want to modernize? Want a router component for integrated it on your own framework? Good news, easyRouter was created with all of those use cases in mind!

Web applications often provide linkable, bookmarkable, shareable URLs for important locations in the app. Until recently, hash fragments (#page) were used to provide these permalinks, but with the arrival of the History API, it's now possible to use standard URLs (/page). easyRouter provides methods for routing client-side pages, and connecting them to actions and events; for browsers which don't yet support the History API, the Router handles graceful fallback and transparent translation to the fragment version of the URL. Basically, it's configured by providing a list of entries and done! then start handling your routes using cross-browser history management, based on either [pushState](http://diveintohtml5.info/history.html) and real URLs, or [onhashchange](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM/window.onhashchange) and URL fragments.

During page load, after your application has finished creating all of its routers, be sure to call Router.history.start(), or Backbone.history.start({pushState: true}) to route the initial URL.

Install it via [Bower](http://bower.io/):
``` bash
bower install easy-router --save
```

Install it via [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/):
``` bash
npm install easy-router --save
```

easyRouter is inspired from the [Backbone.Router](http://backbonejs.org/#Router) and Aurelia's [Router](http://aurelia.io/get-started.html) components:

```javascript
var Router = easyRouter.Router;

var appRouter = new Router({
    map: [
        {
            route: '',
            activate: function () {
                console.log('Entering home page);
                ...
            },
            deactivate: function() {
                // note you can optionally declare an 'deactivate' callback
                // (called before leaving) for each handler.
                console.log('Leaving home page);   
                ...
            }
        },
        {
            route: 'companies/:id',
            activate: function (id) {
                ...
            }
        },
        {
            route: 'signup',
            activate: function () {
                ...
            }
        },
        {
            route: 'some-path/:param1/sub-path/:param2',
            activate: function (param1, param2, queryString, evt) {
                ...
            }
        },
		...
    ]
});


// Listen before navigation happens in this router.
appRouter.on('route:before', function (evt) {
    // prints information about the previous handler (if so)
    console.log(evt.old);
    // prints information about the new handler
    console.log(evt.new);  
    // Check if the current user can access the route; if not,
    // cancel navigation and redirect to 'login'.
    var isAuthenticatedRoute = checkIfRouteNeedsAuthenticatedUser(evt.new.fragment);
    var isAnonymousUser = checkIfAnonymousUser();
    if (isAuthenticatedRoute && isAnonymousUser) {
        evt.canceled = true;
        appRouter.navigate('login');
        return;
    }
    ...
});


// you can alternatively use the function "addHandler" for adding handlers:
appRouter.addHandler({
    route: 'item/:id',
    activate: function (id, queryString, message) {
        // prints {msg: 'Item saved', type: 'success'}
        console.log(message);
        ...
    }
});


// initialize the routers.
Router.history.start({pushState: true});


// client-side redirect to the 'items/:id' handler, it will receive this custom message.
Router.history.navigate('items/a12b', {msg: 'Item saved', type: 'success'});
